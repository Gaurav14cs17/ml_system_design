Randomization Debugging Checklist:

□ Sample Ratio Mismatch Test
  └─ Is observed ratio close to expected?

□ Covariate Balance
  └─ Are pre-treatment characteristics balanced?

□ Assignment Stability
  └─ Does same user always get same variant?

□ Time-Based Patterns
  └─ Any assignment differences by time of day/week?

□ Segment Analysis
  └─ Is ratio consistent across user segments?

□ Bot/Invalid Traffic
  └─ Are bots disproportionately in one group?

□ Technical Validation
  └─ Are there any code paths that bypass randomization?

□ Edge Cases
  └─ How are new users, logged-out users handled?
